# Summarizing {#summarizing}

Hopefully I have succeeded in giving you a better understanding of the internal workings of HA. I hope that this publication has handed you the tools needed to update your vSphere design and ultimately to increase the resiliency and up-time of your environment.

I have tried to simplify some of the concepts to make it easier to understand, still we acknowledge that some concepts are difficult to grasp and the amount of architectural changes that vSphere 5 and new functionality that vSphere 6 have brought can be confusing at times. I hope though that after reading this everyone is confident enough to make the required or recommended changes.

If there are any questions please do not hesitate to reach out me via twitter or my blog, or leave a comment on the online version of this publication. I will do my best to answer your questions.
