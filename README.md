VMware vSphere 6.x HA Deepdive
=======

Like many of you I am constantly trying to explore new ways to share content with the rest of the world. Over the course of the last decade I have done this in many different formats, some of them were easy to do and others not so much. Books always fell in that last category, which is a shame as I have always enjoyed writing them.

I wanted to explore the different options there are to create content and share it in different ways, without the need to re-do formatting and waste a lot of time on things I do not want to waste time on. After an afternoon of reading and researching GitBook popped up. It looked like an interesting platform / solution that would allow me to create content both online and offline, push and pull it to and from a repository and build both a static website from it as well as publish it in a variety of different formats.

Let it be clear that this is a trial, and this may or may not result in a follow up. I am starting with the vSphere High Availability content as that is what I am most familiar with and will be easiest to update.

Now for some formalities, before we dive right in to it. The author of this content works for VMware. The opinion expressed in this publication is the authors’ personal opinion. Content published was not approved in advance by VMware and does not necessarily reflect the view and opinion of VMware. This is the authors’ book, not a VMware book.

A special thanks goes out to everyone who has contributed in any shape or form to this project. First of all Frank Denneman, the person whom I wrote the first 3 versions of the Clustering Deepdive with and who designed all the great diagrams which you find throughout this publication. Of course also: Doug Baer for editing the content in the past and my technical conscious: Keith Farkas, Cormac Hogan, Manoj Krishnan, Anne Holler, Mustafa Uysal and Gabriel Tarasuk-Levin.
