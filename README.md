VMware vSphere 6.x HA Deepdive
=======

Like many of you I am constantly trying to explore new ways to share content with the rest of the world. Over the course of the last decade I have done this in many different formats, some of them were easy to do and others not so much. Books always fell in that last category, which is a shame as I have always enjoyed writing them.

I wanted to explore the different options there are to create content and share it in different ways, without the need to re-do formatting and waste a lot of time on things I do not want to waste time on. After an afternoon of reading and researching GitBook popped up. It looked like an interesting platform / solution that would allow me to create content both online and offline, push and pull it to and from a repository and build both a static website from it as well as publish it in a variety of different formats.

Let it be clear that this is a trial, and this may or may not result in a follow up. I am starting with the vSphere High Availability content as that is what I am most familiar with and will be easiest to update.

A special thanks goes out to everyone who has contributed in any shape or form to this project. First of all Frank Denneman, the person whom I wrote the first 3 versions of the Clustering Deepdive with and who designed all the great diagrams which you find throughout this publication. Of course also: Doug Baer for editing the content in the past and my technical conscious: Keith Farkas, Cormac Hogan, Manoj Krishnan, Anne Holler, Mustafa Uysal and Gabriel Tarasuk-Levin.
